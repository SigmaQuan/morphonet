logs: 

 - Here you can store a log file of any work you’ve done on this project. If you’ll be logging your work, we recommend using the log4r package, which ProjectTemplate will automatically load for you if you turn the logging configuration setting on. The loglevel can be set through the logging_level setting in the configuration, defaults to “INFO”.
